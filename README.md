## About

A simple document distance program to compare similarities between two files using [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).


## Usage

`python3 docdist.py [-s] file1.txt file2.txt`

By default, English stopwords will be used. However, you can pass a custom stop words file from any language. 

## Acknowledgements

The stop words used in this project were sourced from [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org).
